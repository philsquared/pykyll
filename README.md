# PyKyll
A static site generator, with similarities to Jekyll, in Python. Pronounced like "Pickle".

This is currently intended to be used by including this repo as a submodule - but there's no reason that other methods shouldn't work.

Sites are generated from templates, posts (blog posts or articles), and (fixed) content.

### Templating

We now use Jinga2 for templating.
